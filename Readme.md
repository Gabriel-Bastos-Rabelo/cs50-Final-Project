### Introduction
I am currently working on an exciting project as part of the final coursework for Harvard's CS50 course. The project revolves around creating a collaborative photo album platform using a combination of Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and SQLite. The primary objective is to develop a user-friendly web application that allows friends to create shared photo albums within designated groups, enhancing their ability to collectively share and relive memories.

### Project Scope and Features:
The project is well underway and includes a range of key features aimed at providing a comprehensive photo-sharing experience:

#### Login and Registration System:
 Users can securely register and log into the platform, ensuring the privacy and authenticity of their interactions.

#### Album Creation:
 Users have the ability to create new albums, specifying album names and group associations. This feature promotes organized sharing within specific circles of friends.

#### Album Pages:
 Each album has a dedicated page displaying the collection of photos related to that group. The Bootstrap framework is utilized to ensure a responsive and visually appealing layout.

#### Photo Upload:
 Friends within the group can contribute photos to shared albums, thereby curating a collective visual representation of their experiences.

#### Album Invitation:
 Users can asking for join in a group fostering a sense of community and interaction.


#### User-Friendly Interface:
 The Bootstrap framework ensures a user-friendly interface that adapts to different devices, guaranteeing a seamless experience across various screen sizes.

### Technology Stack:
The project leverages a stack of technologies to achieve its goals:

#### Python:
 The core programming language used to develop the backend logic and functionality of the application.

#### Flask:
 A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, utilized to build the web application and manage routing and server-side functionality.

#### Bootstrap:
 A popular front-end framework that aids in creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
